Hello Timothy!

Great work! I've added some very minor comments inside the relevant files. A few things:

js.js ? 

css.css ??? 

You are breaking my heart, have I taught you nothing about semantic naming?!?

You've got a js main.js file that isn't being used, kill it.

Apart from those minor things - excellent job. Välgokänt!
